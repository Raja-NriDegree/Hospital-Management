        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Welcome to our hospital! We are committed to providing excellent medical care to our patients. It’s fundamental human behavior: consumers buy from people, not brands. That's why making an emotional, human connection with the people coming to you for their health and wellness needs is crucial. When they visit your About Us page, you can connect with them based on your values.Brand Transparency

          Seventy-five percent of NeilsonIQ survey respondents indicated they are willing to pay higher prices for products and services from a brand they believe is genuine.
          
          Today’s healthcare consumers are incredibly savvy. They want to understand how your brand operates from the inside out and how you plan to follow your promise.
          
          Your About Us page sets a standard for transparency for your website and the entire company. 
          Shared Values
          
          Your About Us page is the perfect place to articulate your brand’s values and show your target consumers what you stand for. Why? When visitors come to this page, they’re looking for assurance that your brand is aligned with their values—and are more likely to choose your products and services if they are.
          
          In fact, a massive 77% of consumers prefer to buy from companies that share their values. 
          Improved E-E-A-T for SEO
          
          E-E-A-T stands for experience, expertise, authority, and trust and is part of Google’s Search Quality Evaluator Guidelines (guidelines that help Google improve the overall user search experience). 
          
          Websites with high search quality (E-E-A-T) have higher organic rankings on the search engine results page (SERP).
          
          About 55.2% of all users click on the top three organic Google search results.
          
          However, a high search rank isn’t the goal of an About Us page. Instead, it helps add a layer of E-E-A-T to your website and bolsters your overall search engine optimization (SEO) efforts. 
          
          This page shows your consumers why you’re uniquely qualified to offer the services you do, sell what you sell, and educate them about certain topics.
